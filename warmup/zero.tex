\subsection{Algorithms ZeroA, ZeroB and ZeroC}

\subsubsection{Promela implementations}

\textbf{ZeroB}

\textbf{ZeroC}

\subsubsection{LTL formula}

The LTL formula we use to test the correctness of these algorithms is:
\begin{align} \Always ( ( \Eventually found ) \And ( found \Implies \Always found ) ) \end{align}

Found is only set to true when one of the processes finds the zero. Therefore, the first part of this formula, 
\begin{align} \Eventually found \end{align}
ensures that one of the processes does eventually find the zero. 

The second part of this formula, 
\begin{align} found \Implies \Always found \end{align} 
ensures that after one of the processes finds the zero and sets found to true, it will remain true. Since found is the guard on the loop in both processes, this means that both processes will exit their loops and terminate after this occurs.

Finally, the outer \(\Always\) ensures that these parts of the formula are satisfied in all states. Without this, the formula would only need to be satisfied in one state for the program to pass checking.

\subsection{Algorithms ZeroD and ZeroE}

\subsubsection{Promela implementations}

\textbf{ZeroD}

\textbf{ZeroE}

\subsubsection{LTL formula}

The LTL formula we use to test the correctness of these algorithms is:
\begin{align} 
\Always ( ( \Eventually found ) \And ( found \Implies \Always found )\notag\\
\And ( P@pTurnChange \Implies \Eventually P@pAfterTurnChange )\\
\And ( Q@qTurnChange \Implies \Eventually Q@qAfterTurnChange ) )\notag
\end{align}

The first two parts of this formula are the same as those used for algorithms ZeroA, ZeroB and ZeroC and are explained above. However, these cannot prevent a program from permanently blocking inside its await statement (and never terminating) after found has been set to true. The latter two parts of the formula,
\begin{align} 
( P@pTurnChange \Implies \Eventually P@pAfterTurnChange )\notag\\
\And ( Q@qTurnChange \Implies \Eventually Q@qAfterTurnChange ) 
\end{align}
prevent this by ensuring that if a process enters its await statement, it eventually exits it.

\section{Question 2}

We defined the Owicki/Gries style proof of the partial correctness of \texttt{zeroE} as
\begin{equation}
    \{ \textrm{$f$ is a function over $\Integer$ with at least one zero} \}
    \texttt{zeroE}
    \{ x \in \Integer \And f(x)=0 \}
\label{eq:og-proof}
\end{equation}

For the proof, we constructed the transition diagram for process $P$ (Figure \ref{fig:p-trans}) and the transition diagram for $Q$ (Figure \ref{fig:q-trans}).
Each state corresponds to the appropriate line of code in the processes and assertions at each state are given in blue.

To aid in the proof we defined two global auxiliary boolean variables $fP$ and $fQ$.
These variables are true if states $p6$ and $q6$ have ever been visited respectively, and are false otherwise.
To achieve this, both variables are initially set to false, and are set to true when transitioning into their respective states $p6$ or $q6$.

We then introduce the global invariant
\begin{equation}
    I: \quad found = fP \Or fQ
\label{eq:og-invariant}
\end{equation}
This invariant is maintained at every state as:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initially all three variables $found$, $fP$ and $fQ$ are false.
    \item In the states that change $found$, $fP$ or $fQ$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item State $p6$ sets both $found$ and $fP$ to true, maintaining the invariant.
        \item Likewise, state $q6$ sets both $found$ and $fQ$ to true, maintaining the invariant.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The assertions on the transition diagrams can now be established. Consider the transition diagram for $P$. The assertions are proven as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item At all states: $\{i\ge0\}$ is true as initially $i:=0$ and the only transition to alter $i$ is $p3 -> p4$ which increments $i$.
    \item At $p2$: $\{!fP\}$ is derived from the transition condition and $I$. There is no interference as $Q$ does not alter $fP$.
    \item At $p3$ and $p4$: $\{!fP\}$ is maintained as $fP$ is not altered. There is no interference as $Q$ does not alter $fP$.
    \item At $p5$: $\{f(i)=0\}$ is given from the transition condition and there is no interference as $i$ is local to $P$.
    \item At $p6$: $\{f(i)=0\}$ is given as $i$ is unchanged. $\{fP\}$ is given from the transition action. There is no interference as $Q$ does not alter $i$ or $fP$.
    \item At $p1$: $\{fP \rightarrow f(i)=0\}$ named $a1$, is given by the transitions into $p1$ from $p4$ and $p6$.
          From $p4$, the assertion $\{!fP\}$ makes $a1$ trivially true.
          From $p6$ the assertions $\{fP\}$ and $\{f(i)=0\}$ ensure $a1$ is true.
    \item At $p7$: the assertion $\{fP \rightarrow f(i)=0\}$ is maintained as either $fP$ or $i$ is changed, and there is no interference as neither is modified by $Q$.
\end{enumerate}

The assertions on the transition diagram for $Q$ can be established in a similar way, so we do not detail them here.

We finally must establish the assertions at the terminal states of $P$ and $Q$ imply the overall partial correctness for \texttt{zeroE}.
The set of assertions from the terminal states $p7$ and $q7$ are:
\begin{align*}
    I: \quad found &= fP \Or fQ \\
    fo&und \\
    i &\ge 0 \\
    j &\le 1 \\
    fP &\rightarrow f(i) = 0 \\
    fQ &\rightarrow f(j) = 0
\end{align*}

Given $found$ and $I$, the implications can be collapsed to give
\begin{align*}
    i &\ge 0 \\
    j &\le 1 \\
    f(i) = 0 &\Or f(j) = 0
\end{align*}

Finally, as the combined values of $i$ and $j$ cover $\Integer$, we can conclude what was required, that is
\begin{equation}
    x \in \Integer \And f(x) = 0
\label{eq:og-conclusion}
\end{equation}
